## Use cases

Recruiters will be able to log in and manage applications by entering their credentials at the login screen. Applicants will be able to register with a simple click on the header toolbar.

An applicant is after a successful login able to update their personal information as well as send in an application to all recruiters specifying their professional competence as well as the days they are available for work.

A recruiter is able to view and review all applications and decide if they're to be accepted or rejected.
